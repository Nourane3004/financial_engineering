This project implements a multi-agent trading system (MACRO_INSIGHT, QUANT_MODELER, PATTERN_DETECTOR, RISK_MANAGER, RAG_AGENT).
A central orchestrator collects market data, distributes it to agents, aggregates their signals, and produces a final trading decision.
A Streamlit interface displays the agents’ outputs, charts, and explanations.
